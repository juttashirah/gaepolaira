I had my 1 year a few days ago, what a trip! 13 months or so ago I figured I'd be dead by now, so it's still a little shocking to be writing this. /r/stopdrinking was my #1 resource in the hardest parts of the first year, so a profound thank you to everyone here, I almost certainly wouldn't be sober had this place not existed.

I don’t even know where to start. I’ll try to keep this concise and to the point, but apologies in advance if it seems rambl-y and all over the place. My brain hurts. Husband quit his job of 6+ years Friday; it was a long time coming, and I’ve been begging him to do it since we met, so that’s not the issue. Not the best timing, at all, but it is what it is. I’m thrilled for him to be able to move on, as this job was so toxic and shitty. However, I AM super concerned that he seems so lax about. Рамблер — поисковая система Рамблер.

I have an extremely hard time orgasming and several key parts of my body are too damaged to touch for long periods of time. I want to do things for my dom. One thing I've ALWAYS wanted to do was forced orgasms. But i can't seem to even have one without an hour long buildup and i feel ashamed for that. How do you move past trauma and dedicate yourself to your dom? Obvious.

This is a problem I've been having recently. The past five days, I've been unable to enjoy splatoon. And that's because of the Octo expansion secret boss. I swear, fighting against that boss is the most infuriating thing I've experienced in my life. I've had splatoon 2 since release, and I had splatoon 1 for a while as well. I did EVERYTHING in splatoon 1. All levels, scrolls, and amiibo challenges. Same with both Splatoon 2 main game and octo expansion. Every level, every weapon.

There’s a phrase I think most mothers would agree to be true, “you are only as happy as your least happy child.” It’s the reason I have hardly spoken to my mother in months. She tends to think I’m upset with her. Or busy. Or just my normal “don’t wanna be bothered” self. Granted I am busy often. I am an introvert and find human interaction to be.exhausting. Especially when most of my interactions are “fake it til you make it.” My mother has been one of my best friends since I was a child.

I am looking for my first entry level position from a very broad perspective right now, meaning not only engineering positions but also technician and other consultant-type positions in the environmental services industry.

As much as I sometimes feel like I want to back out, I've made it impossible now. I've committed myself. I wish I didn't have to wait until September 7th. The pain is killing me. I know it's going to get worse before it gets better. I just want to start the getting better part as soon as possible.

I've lurked on this sub for ~ a year since I got into college hoping to make a major change in my social life since I graduated high school. I took all the advice the wonderful people on this sub have provided for free and started to strictly diet, work out religiously, study and network for high paying jobs, buy better fitting and stylish clothing, fix my personal hygiene and acne, and tried to put myself out there more socially.

Sooooo after asking which tales game I should try out next and getting quite a few recommendations for Eternia I played it and I have just beat it and it was a great time (: Story(no spoilers): Sooooo the story I've always heard mixed things about usually leaning towards the side of meh or bad but after experiencing it myself I gotta say I actually really liked the story. It starts off bland but I think definitely gets better especially after Mt. Farlos. That was a turning point I think.

Sorry for a rambl-y kind of post, I just wanted to mention the amazing false sense of security that the game gives you at the end of Delta Rune (chapter 1). Toby Fox uses themes and characters from the original Undertale game to make you feel at home; you pass Sans, Undyne and other familiar characters as you go back towards your home (even if everything feels slightly off and unsettling).

Little hints have popped up pretty regularly since I was 12 or 13, and I've considered the possibility I might be trans since I was about 22.

Ok so I've been feeling more down than usual these past few days and my boss just told me to go home because there's no more work today. So now I am stuck all by myself, all day just, just me and my thoughts. I also have a bunch of weed that I'd like to smoke but I feel like if I smoke now I might just fall deeper into the lonelieness.

Jeffery of Chicago, Illinois and builder of the Rambler bicycle, constructed his first prototype automobile. I'm 21 years old, and I have no friends. I've tried making friends at work, but I get along better with guys for the most part, and none of them want to be friends with me because I have a boyfriend. My boyfriend works at the same place I do and sometimes I feel like I can't get a breath of air without him around. I want to work on myself, and be independent but I just can't break away. I love my boyfriend, and I want to be with him, but I just need some space sometimes. I'm always surrounded.

Before getting into the water i chugged a 0,33 of beer. Then 4 hours later I had a beer with lunch at a bar then another one when I got back home. Рамбл (англ.
