                            <p> Imma just copy and paste it here. desktop Prebuilt intel core i7 16gb memory Nvidia geforce gtx 1060 120gb SSD 1tb hard drive Cost is about 1070$, and I think it's about to go on sale next week. Doesn't come with monitor, so that'll be about 150$ Doesn't come with a CD/DVD Drive, so that may be about 30-50$ I know I could probably build a better computer for half the price, but with College and work, I have neither the time or experience, and to be direct, I just don't wanna bother. I downloaded Razor 1911 Skyrim file. I can not get it to mount on to my daemon tools driver. It will say mounting image and then the message will go away and the installer will not show up. When I try to click on the driver on "This PC" I get the error message that the disc may be corrupt and need to be formatted. So for years i have been using daemon tools lite and decided around yesterday it would be a good idea to update daemon tools since i havent updated in a really long time, that turned out to be a mistake as it would never let me create a virtual driver again. I always get an error: 1500 that does not let me create the virtual driver. I have tried reinstalling daemon tools again and again and had even resorted to trying a pirated version of daemon tools pro but that didn't work either. Just finished my pc build, downloaded the Windows 7 iso and put it on a newly formatted usb drive. My PC recognizes it and attempts to install Windows from it but as it goes through the installed it says that I'm missing driver files. I've tried using the Windows usb/dvd download tool but that didn't help. Does anyone Every day, often several times a day, I am getting a BSOD or a complete freeze. Event Viewer keeps showing these error reports: ERROR 1 ( ERROR 2 ( comes 3-10 seconds after ERROR 1 WARNING 1 ( and WARNING 2 ( come with ERROR 2 INFORMATION 1 ( comes sometime soon after ERROR 1 So far I have tried uninstalling Windows Security Essentials (and replacing As we all know, there was recently a major update for Windows 10. Immediately after this update my compatibility assistant went crazy spamming notifications stating "This app can't run on this PC. Daemon Tools doesn't work on this version of windows. Learn More." Every time I open file browser or try to save a file the notifications roll in, approximately 18-22 of this same notification until it will subside. I tried to uninstall Daemon Tools, and as a result the same notification 
Specs: Win7 64 bit i5-3450, 3.1 GHz Sapphire r9 390x Nitro (8GB) 8GB DDR3 RAM PC Power and Cooling silencer mk ii 750w So I've been having issues for a while now that I think are GPU or driver related. Pretty much at least once per day chrome will briefly lockup and I'll get a message saying something about display drivers crashing and recovering. My understanding is that this is related to hardware acceleration in chrome. Later I started seeing quite a bit of nasty artifact Hey guys, I've tried getting help from some guys over at the live chat but unfortunately they haven't been able to help. Here's a screenshot of what BlueScreenView shows: I've tried running sfc scannow, it found no errors. I ran memtest until it told me it had completed and there were no errors. I've run Display Driver Uninstaller and reinstalled my graphics card drivers. I'm all out of ideas here. Using Windows 10. Tonight my computer also entirely locked. I've already installed my OS and graphics card. Any good programs/advice would be appreciated. EDIT: I'm sorry, I meant besides the ones on the sidebar. I thought that was implied. I just had my first BSOD on my month old-build, should I worry? The error was DPC_Watchdog_Violation, and I got it while playing FC4. Any idea what the problem was? I've tried looking it up, but I am not able to find a specific answer to my problem. So lately, every morning I will wake up and turn on my computer, put in my password and then go eat breakfast. After I eat, I will come back to my computer either at the log-in screen (meaning it BSOD'd and restarted) or have a BSOD up. The three error messages I get are: BAD_POOL_HEADER SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL I built my computer back in early December, and now my parents are mad at me because they think my computer is busted. After it BSODs, I'll restart # Oloid Toolbox - The all-in-one Legacy Toolbox Release Date Plan for 5/1/19 and it's possible to be done before that :) If you have any questions you can reply or msg me on twitter @tie1r or @oloidcc Also looking for testers so please let me know thank you! We also have a website with some screenshots and more info: ## What is Oloid Toolbox? It's a Desktop program for Legacy Devices similar to 3u Tools which is for Newer Devices It brings all Legacy Tools together. #THE ISSUE HAS BEEN FIXED. IT WAS MY PSU ALL ALONG. YES I KNOW THIS WAS SUGGESTED EARLIER BUT I DIDNT HAVE A PSU TO SWAP IN. I've had this issue for the past few months and I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I am desperate for a fix. I've tried many things and to no avail the issue persists. #Here's my issue: When I play games, randomly, my PC will power off and restart. Never a BSOD, just a black screen and then power comes back on like nothing happened. It never does this while. \ IGS rep page 1\ ( https://www.reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/4u4jji/morec33s\_igs\_rep\_page/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/4u4jji/morec33s_igs_rep_page/)) amp#x200B; \ IGS rep page 2\ ( https://www.reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/6k9fck/morec33s\_igs\_rep\_page\_2/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/6k9fck/morec33s_igs_rep_page_2/)) amp#x200B; \ IGS rep page 3\ ( https://www.reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/7mz4dp/morec33s\_igs\_rep\_page\_3/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/IGSRep. This is a slightly complex issue to explain so bear with me! Last month I was using Skype when it logged me out without warning. When I went to log in again it didn't recognise my password and I was unable to use the recovery tools to get in. It was an old account not connected to an email address (that I can remember) so I got confused but moved on. I tried setting up a new account as a test, using a disposable email address, and the same thing happened. I wasn't able to recover
